  abstract = {Thrombopoietin (TPO, c-Mpl ligand) is considered to play an important role in the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production by activating the cytokine receptor c-Mpl. We have examined the binding of 125I-TPO to the human megakaryocytic cell line, CMK, and to primary human megakaryocytes. Scatchard analysis of TPO binding to its cognate receptor in megakaryocytic cells suggested the existence of a single class of c-Mpl receptors. CMK cells exhibited 1223 receptors per cell with a dissociation constant (Kd) of Kd = 223 pM, whereas primary human megakaryocytes exhibited 12140 receptors per cell and a dissociation constant of Kd = 749 pM. The pretreatment of CMK cells and primary bone marrow megakaryocytes with TPO resulted in a decreased binding of TPO to the c-Mpl receptors. This down-regulation was observed within 3 h and was not inhibited by cycloheximide. Phorbol ester, an activator of protein kinase C, also inhibited TPO binding to the c-Mpl receptors by reducing the number of these receptors. The pretreatment of CMK cells with IL-3, IL-6 and DMSO, all of which induced the differentiation of CMK cells, did not affect the binding of TPO to the c-Mpl receptors. These results suggest an additional mechanism, where protein kinase C may help to regulate the binding of TPO to these cells.},

  abstract = {Thrombopoietin (c-Mpl ligand) has recently been purified and is considered to be the humoral regulator of platelet production. To see whether this molecule possessed the physiologic characteristics necessary to mediate the feed-back loop between blood platelets and the bone marrow megakaryocytes, we determined the relationship between blood levels of thrombopoietin and changes in the circulating platelet mass. We developed a model of nonimmune thrombocytopenia in rabbits by the subcutaneous administration of busulfan. Compared with pretreatment plasma, plasma taken from all thrombocytopenic rabbits at their platelet nadir contained increased amounts of thrombopoietin. All of this activity was neutralized by soluble c-Mpl receptor. We subsequently measured the level of thrombopoietin in the circulation over the entire time course after the administration of busulfan. As the platelet mass declined, levels of thrombopoietin increased inversely and proportionally and peaked during the platelet nadir. With return of the platelet mass toward normal, thrombopoietin levels decreased accordingly. When platelets were transfused into thrombocytopenic rabbits near the time of their platelet count nadir, the elevated levels of thrombopoietin decreased. In addition, platelets were observed to remove thrombopoietin from thrombocytopenic plasma in vitro. These results confirm that thrombopoietin is the humoral mediator of megakaryocytopoiesis and suggest that the platelet mass may directly play a role in regulating the circulating levels of this factor.},
